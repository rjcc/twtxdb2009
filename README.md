2009 Taiwan National Transplant Database Analytics

The raw data was stored on PostgreSQL platform which was non-public.  All the work were done in 2009, 15 years ago.  I could not find my SQL code programs and am unable to share them here.  Once I found my SQL programs, I'll add them here.

Here shared are the Stata programs, outputs, and reports.  Data access is restricted and available upon request.

Environment setting is different on each user's machine.  So these Stata programs need some modifications to run in the machines other than mine.

Just my show case.
